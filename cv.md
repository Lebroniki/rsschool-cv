##About me:##

I'm working today like a barber. I do it 5 years. But 5-ve years ago
I had choice try study Barbering or Frontend but then i even didn't know that this profession called in this way. I'm just had thinking that today more and more businesses need they own sites. I'm started interested this . I'm had find site with lessons which contains information about HTML and CSS and I studied it. When I recognise that for sites I need JavaScript (language programming) I'm started thinking that it's not my. Because had thinking that for programming I need to know very good mathematics and I didn't have friends with this area and nobody can't told me that mathematics I need only base. I'm started study like a Barber.
But today when my financial situation more better and a have many familiar it this area who even told me about this course . I would like try do it! but already today I don't have many time.

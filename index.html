                I had choice try study Barbering or Frontend but then i even didn’t know that this profession called in this way. 
                I’m just had thinking that today more and more businesses need they own sites. I’m started interested this . 
                I’m had find site with lessons which contains information about HTML and CSS and I studied it.
                 When I recognise that for sites I need JavaScript (language programming) I’m started thinking that it’s not my.
                  Because had thinking that for programming I need to know very good mathematics and 
                  I didn’t have friends with this area and nobody can’t told me that mathematics I need only base. I’m started study like a Barber. But today when my financial situation more better and a have many familiar it this area who even told me about this course .
